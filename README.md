# Project-1
# Cloudy with a Chance of Cocktails

This application was built with HTML, CSS, Bulma, and Javascript. Users can search for a city and will be suggested a drink based on the city's weather conditions. The simple layout shows two cards. One for the City's forecast and the other card with a picture of a complimented drink. The drink card also gives the name and ingredients for said drink.
